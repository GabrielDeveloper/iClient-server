# IClient

 Application in for visits of customers

### Tech

 Client uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework 
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system

And of course IClient itself is open source with a [public repository][iclient]
 on GitHub.
